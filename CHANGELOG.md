## [1.0.0]

### Added
- Release of the HydroSAR package, as used in the [hyp3-watermap](https://hyp3-watermap.asf.alaska.edu) production environment
  - The HydroSAR codes were initially added to the [asf_tools](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/asf-tools) package for convenience but has been migrated here to foster better co-development and better credit the HydroSAR project. See [#8](https://github.com/fjmeyer/HydroSAR/pull/8) for more details
