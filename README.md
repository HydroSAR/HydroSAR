## About the HydroSAR Project
HydroSAR is a project funded by the NASA Applied Sciences Program focused on the development of algorithms for the monitoring of hydrological hazards using data from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. Algorithms are being developed for the following SAR-derived products:
- **RTC30:** Time series of Radiometrically Terrain Corrected (RTC) SAR images provided at 30 m resolution.
- **RTC30-Color:** RGB compositions of from dual-pol (VV/VH) Sentinel-1 SAR RTC image products provided at 30 m resolution.
- **CCD30:** Change detection products relative to the first image of an event subscription (30 m resolution).
- **HYDRO30:** Surface water extent maps per Sentinel-1 SAR image acquisition (30 m resolution).
- **AG100:** Agriculture extent maps derived by statistical analyses of RTC30 time series stacks (provided at 1 ha resolution).
- **AG30-IN:** Maps of inundated agriculture (1 ha resolution).
