# HydroSAR
## About the HydroSAR Project
HydroSAR is a project funded by the NASA Applied Sciences Program focused on the development of algorithms for the monitoring of hydrological hazards using data from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. Algorithms are being developed for the following SAR-derived products:
- **RTC30:** Time series of Radiometrically Terrain Corrected (RTC) SAR images provided at 30 m resolution.
- **RTC30-Color:** RGB compositions of from dual-pol (VV/VH) Sentinel-1 SAR RTC image products provided at 30 m resolution.
- **CCD30:** Change detection products relative to the first image of an event subscription (30 m resolution).
- **HYDRO30:** Surface water extent maps per Sentinel-1 SAR image acquisition (30 m resolution).
- **AG100:** Agriculture extent maps derived by statistical analyses of RTC30 time series stacks (provided at 1 ha resolution).
- **AG30-IN:** Maps of inundated agriculture (1 ha resolution).

# FIERpy Pipeline Instructions:

## Order RTC jobs and launch your server
The pipeline was made to work directly with ASFâ€™s Vertex RTC images. 
- Order jobs on [Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/#/) (wait maybe an hour before they have been processed). **MAKE SURE YOU ORDER THE DEMS WITH YOUR RTC IMAGES**
- Start your [OpenScienceLab](http://opensciencelab.asf.alaska.edu/) server to access high RAM performance and the appropriate python environments (you can also directly download the notebooks on [Github](https://github.com/fjmeyer/HydroSAR/tree/Workflow_Forecast) but be aware that FIERpy needs A LOT of RAM (often more than 40 Gb).

## Download the RTCs and precipitation data.
- Launch Notebook a1. It might take some time to download all the RTC images. You can delete the zips but **do not delete the main RTCs once unzipped**.
- Launch Notebook 1bis. This might take a few hours, depending on the queue of [Copernicus](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview) servers. *Once launched, let the notebook opened until you have a file in the ERA folder.* **You can run Notebooks 2 to 4 while waiting for Notebook 1bis to run**
### Data for Development
The RTC tiffs and ERA5 precipitation data can be acquired by downloading them from an s3 bucket. This allows us to skip notebooks a1 and 1b (and projects in VERTEX timing out) and save some significant time. These instructions are meant for Franz, so he can work on the same dataset as Kas. 
To access and copy from the s3 bucket:
- aws s3 cp --recursive {folder to copy to} {location in s3 bucket}
- Locations in s3 Bucket
  - Northeastern river of Bangladesh: s3://asf-jupyter-data-west/knicely/bang_NE/
  - Pair of adjacent watersheds in Nepal: s3://asf-jupyter-data-west/knicely/Nepal_sF/
  - Sylhet region of Bangladesh: s3://asf-jupyter-data-west/knicely/bang_sylhet/
  - Note:
    - Each bucket contains a folder named 'RTC_GAMMA__tiffs'. These tiffs have been subsetted and are ready for Notebook a3 - Water masking.
    - The Sylhet bucket contains both a folder named 'RTC_GAMMA__tiffs' and a zip file named 'sylhet_pre-subset.zip'. The zip file contains the original unmerged tiffs. This has been done due to issues with merging and subsetting the tiffs causing the water mask creation in Notebook a3 to fail to execute properly. 
- Example: To download the subsetted tiffs of the northeastern river in Bangladesh from the s3 bucket into a folder named 'my_RTC_GAMMA__tiffs' would use the following command:
  -   aws s3 cp --recursive my_RTC_GAMMA__tiffs s3://asf-jupyter-data-west/knicely/bang_NE/RTC_GAMMA__tiffs
  - This will copy the contents of the s3 bucket ending in 'RTC_GAMMA__tiffs' into the folder in Open Science Lab named 'my_RTC_GAMMA__tiffs'

## Choose your AOI, generate its Water Masks. (The HAND DEM is now pulled from a repository)
- Launch Notebook a2. Crop the RTCs to your AOI. Trial-and-error might have to happen in order to find an AOI that does not blow-up your RAM during the REOF (Notebook 5).
- Launch Notebook a3. If you activate the post-processing, it might take a few hours. If not, it might take up to 30min if you have around 90 RTC images.

## Compute the forecast
**Only after you have downloaded [ERA5 precipitation data](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview) and computed HAND DEM with Water Masks**
- Launch Notebook a4. It can take a few hours to compute. Follow the instructions, make sure the indices you select for the forecast time-window are 12 days total. An error message should pop-up if it's not the case.
*Remember: this forecast does not actually forecast past your present day. GEOGLOWS (discharge input) is generally stops 2 months before your current date, and 1 month for ERA5.*
