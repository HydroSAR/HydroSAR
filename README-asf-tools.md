## ArcGIS Toolbox
The [ArcGIS Python Toolbox](ArcGIS-toolbox) can be used with either ArcGIS Desktop or 
ArcGIS Pro, and contains tools that perform geoprocessing tasks useful for working
with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The tools were designed to be used with
Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) SAR datasets, such as those enerated by
[HyP3](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/), but several of the tools have the
potential to be used with a variety of rasters, including non-SAR datasets.

More information and a download link is also provided on
[ASF's website](https://asf.alaska.edu/how-to/data-tools/gis-tools/)

The Toolbox is distributed as a zipped archive including the `.pyt` Toolbox script
and associated `.xml` files. There is an XML file for the toolbox itself and one
for each of the tools it contains. These XML files contain the metadata displayed
in the item descriptions and tool help windows, and must be kept in the same directory 
as the Python Toolbox (`.pyt`) file, or the information they contain will no longer
be accessible to ArcGIS.

## ASF Tools for Python

[asf_tools](asf_tools) is a Python package for working with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data.
It was designed for working with datasets generated by
[HyP3](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/), but several of the tools have the
potential to be used with a variety of rasters, including non-SAR datasets.

`asf_tools` is distributed on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) and 
[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/introduction.html). See our
[documentation](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/tools/asf_tools/) for installation
and usage.
