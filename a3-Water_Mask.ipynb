    "# Flood Mapping from Single Sentinel-1 SAR Images\n",
    "\n",
    "**Franz J Meyer, University of Alaska Fairbanks**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents the SAR-based flood mapping approach developed and used in the HydroSAR project. In its general concepts, the approach follows a methodology developed by the German Aerospace Center and published in [Sentinel-1-based flood mapping: a fully automated processing chain](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01431161.2016.1192304) by Twele et al. The approach is based on radiometrically terrain corrected (RTC processed) Sentinel-1 SAR data and applies a dynamic thresholding method followed by fuzzy-logic-based post processing procedure. This notebook has both steps of this process implemented, but by default, the fuzzy logic step is deactivated to save processing time. The notebook will explain how the fuzzy logic post processing step can be activated should full performance processing be of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "The approach is based on image amplitude data and is capable of detecting standing surface water. Note that flooding under vegetation will not be detected by this approach."
